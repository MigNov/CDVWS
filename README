  Config-View-Definition WebServer
 ==================================

This application has been written as the lightweight form of the
webserver that *should* support internal database, called CDB,
eventually IDB, the webserver stack itself, the XML-based scripting
language.

The name has been derived from it's designed functionality (please see
design-document.pdf for more information) as the project should be
having config, view, definition directories with files in them.

The structure should be seen in the examples directory:
 - config & config.d should contain all the configuration data,
   including the connection strings and the others
 - definition directory should contain all the XML-based definition
   files defining the system functions to be called from within the
   views
 - views directory should be having the raw HTML/CSS layout that
   is publicly accessible

Please refer to design-document.pdf for more information.

The whole application is written in C language with requirements for
just few libraries, like libxml2 and others.
